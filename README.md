# Django-HTMX
in this project, I used Django and Bokeh library to create a bar chart that visualizes country GDP's between 1960 and 2016. The data comes from our Django app;s database, and I used tools from the Bokeh library to create and style a bar chart..
Users will be able to update the chart to look at a specific year, and to update the amount of countries shown on the chart(i.e. the number of bars)
